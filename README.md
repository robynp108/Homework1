# 01 Marketing SEO Refactor
> Refactor of a marketing page to be more SEO friendly

## Completed
Semantic HTML elements:
  -Changed div around header list to nav.
  -Changed divs around class="content" and contained items to sections.
  -Changed divs around class="benefits" and contents to asides.
  -Changed divs with classes "header" and "footer" to header and footer elements.
  -Changed all relevant CSS to match.
  
Alt attributes:
  - Added alt attributes to all images.
  - Changed background image to regular image tag so it would accept an alt attribute.

Heading attributes to sequential order:
  - Footer was originally an h2, after an h3. I changed it to an h3, still looks to be a reasonable size.
  
Title element:
  - Added title, name of company, Horiseon.
