!! brief description


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning


WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes


WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
  - Footer was originally an h2, after an h3. I changed it to an h3, still looks to be a reasonable size.

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
  - Added title, name of company, Horiseon.
